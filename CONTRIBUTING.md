If you want to contribute new challenges have a look at the random module

Changing current challenges should be done by increasing the version in the Challenge (named Algorithm in code) after changing the corresponding function. You should use somewhat reasonable steps.

For fix 0.0.-

Other contributions are welcomed too.

Some ideas:

layout
styling
new ways to show the current challenge
wording in the code and user interface
