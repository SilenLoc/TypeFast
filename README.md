# TypeFast (Beta)
A typing practice tool

It is intended to be extensible by more and more challenges.

The web version is at https://silenloc.github.io/TypeFast/

If you want to contribute new challenges have a look at the [random module][1]

Changing current challenges should be done by increasing the version in the Challenge (named Algorithm in code) after changing the corresponding function.
You should use somewhat reasonable steps. 

- For fix 0.0.-
- For additions 0.-.0
- For behaviour change -.0.0

Other contributions are welcomed too.

Some ideas:

- layout 
- styling
- new ways to show the current challenge
- wording in the code and user interface
- make challenges more performant

Roadmap:

- Your own Themes
- 20 different Challenges
