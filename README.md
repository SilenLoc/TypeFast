# TypeFast
A typing practice tool

It is intended to be extensible by more and more challenges.

If you want to contribute new challenges have a look at the [random module][1]

Other contributions are welcomed too.

Some ideas:

- layout 
- styling
- new ways to show the current challenge
- wording in the code and user interface
